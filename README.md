# Webpack Browser Extension Boilerplate

A (really bad) template for creating Chrome extensions using webpack, SCSS and Firebase.

## Features 


## Todo before using
 + Change the name and details in `extension/manifest.json`, both `package.json`s, etc.
 + Edit the manifest to specify the correct permissions, content script match pattern, etc.
 + Update webpack.config.js with your license banner (check bottom of file) and any other necesarry changes
 + Set uninstall URL, etc. in background page

Contributions are always welcome! This template is quite opininated and optimized for my own projects, so I may not accept all suggestions. However, please open an issue if you see something that could be improved!
